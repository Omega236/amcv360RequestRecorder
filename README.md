# amcv360RequestRecorder

This Windows Forms application should help you to form webrequests to integrate the 360 S6 vacuum robot into other applications like openhab, iobroker, alexa-skill, etc.

You can record the webrequests that are sent from the iOS or Android app. After recording you'll be able to replay those requests to control the robot.

Currently suppport commands are: StartCleaning, StopCleaning and GoCharging.

If you want to help me, please send me the resulting .json-file to amcv@mnetworx.de. I'll use it with care and i'll not use the requests to control your device :) !!
